ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project simulates the propagation of gamma photons through different materials using a 2D interactive simulation.
Users can select:

Material type (Aluminum, Lead, Steel, Copper, Iron, Gold, Tungsten)

One or multiple radioactive sources (Co-60, Cs-137, Na-22)

Material thickness

The simulation shows:

Photon movement through the material (2D scatter plot)

Real-time detector photon counts

Energy spectrum histogram for the photons reaching the detector

This project is designed for educational and portfolio purposes in nuclear physics and radiation studies.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Multiple radioactive sources with different energies

Interactive GUI for user-friendly selection

Photon energy color mapping in the simulation

Real-time graphs for photon counts and energy spectra

Built with Python, matplotlib, and tkinter

ðŸ”¹ How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/InteractiveGammaSimulator.git


Install required libraries (if not already installed):

pip install numpy matplotlib


Run the simulation:

python gamma_simulator.py


Use the GUI to select material, radioactive sources, and thickness, then start the simulation.

ðŸ”¹ Screenshot / GIF

(You can add a screenshot or GIF of your simulation here to make it visually appealing.)

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements

Add multi-layered materials

Include Monte Carlo energy distribution for more realistic spectra

3D visualization or more interactive graphics
