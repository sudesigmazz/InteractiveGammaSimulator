# InteractiveGammaSimulator

**Interactive 2D gamma ray simulation with multiple sources and real-time energy spectrum.**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project simulates the propagation of gamma photons through different materials using a **2D interactive simulation**.  
Users can select:  
- Material type (Aluminum, Lead, Steel, Copper, Iron, Gold, Tungsten)  
- One or multiple radioactive sources (Co-60, Cs-137, Na-22)  
- Material thickness  

The simulation shows:  
- Photon movement through the material (2D scatter plot)  
- Real-time **detector photon counts**  
- **Energy spectrum** histogram for the photons reaching the detector  

This project is designed for **educational and portfolio purposes** in nuclear physics and radiation studies.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- **Multiple radioactive sources** with different energies  
- **Interactive GUI** for user-friendly selection  
- **Photon energy color mapping** in the simulation  
- **Real-time graphs** for photon counts and energy spectra  
- Built with **Python**, **matplotlib**, and **tkinter**

## ðŸ”¹ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sudesigmazz/InteractiveGammaSimulator.git
```
2.Install required libraries (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
3.Run the simulation:
```bash
python gamma_simulator.py
```

4.Use the GUI to select material, radioactive sources, and thickness, then start the simulation.
